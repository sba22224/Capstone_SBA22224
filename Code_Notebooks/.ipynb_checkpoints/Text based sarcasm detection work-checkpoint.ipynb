Features in the text which will be extracted include the frequencies of structural features of the text such as capitalized words, capitalisation within words, user mentions, hashtags, markers of laughter, punctuation, emoji frequency, and linguistic features including the presence of vocabulary classed as an intensifiers, interjectors, negators or affirmators. These features are each postulated to provide indicators of pragmatics within the text and thus may be able to provide insight into how sarcasm is detected within text."
